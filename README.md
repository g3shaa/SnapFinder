# SnapFinder

This project is a simple web application for searching photos by keywords. It uses the Flickr API to retrieve photos based on the user's search query and displays the results in a responsive grid.

# How to use

To use the application, simply enter a keyword in the search input and click the "Search" button. The app will fetch photos from Unsplash that match the keyword and display them in the results grid. You can click on any photo to view it in full size on Unsplash.
